(Crucial for survey alignment).\n    -   `fear_of_authority`: Do they fear professors/bosses?\n-   `academic_profile`:\n    -   `primary_motivation`: Why are they studying? (Money? Passion? Parents? Wasting time?).\n    -   `self_efficacy`: Are they good at note-taking and planning? Do they believe they will succeed?\n\n**OUTPUT LANGUAGE:** All details MUST be in Persian (Farsi).",
